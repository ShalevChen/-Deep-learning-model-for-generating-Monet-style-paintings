 Deep learning model for generating Monet-style paintings . Using Python




The field of computer vision has witnessed remarkable advancements powered by
deep learning, notably in the domain of generative models. For this final project,
we leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize images that
emulate the distinctive artistic styles of master painters such as Claude Monet.
Akin to how artists develop unique visual signatures, our objective is to computationally
capture and replicate the essential stylistic elements characterizing an
artistâ€™s oeuvre. Achieving this artistic style transfer through algorithmic means
presents significant challenges at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning,
and fine arts, making it an intriguing interdisciplinary exploration.
